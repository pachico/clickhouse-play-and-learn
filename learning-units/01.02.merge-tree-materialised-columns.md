# MergeTree Materialised Columns

Sometimes you might want to do some transformation or apply certain logic at insert time over a column so you don't have to do it at query time.  
ClickHouse offers something is called `materialized columns` to solve this.  
We will now learn how to use it.

## Table creation

Let's open a client and create a database and a table:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mergetree;
```

and use it (this means selecting it):

```sql
use mergetree;
```

and create a simple table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS matcolumn
(
    `number` UInt32, 
    `parity` Enum('even' = 1, 'odd' = 2) MATERIALIZED IF(modulo(number, 2) = 0, 'even', 'odd')
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY tuple()
ORDER BY number;
```

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/conditional-functions/#if

Let's understand what is happening here:

- `number` is the column we will insert data into
- `parity` is a column of type `Enum` which accepts only the values `even` and `odd` and will be calculated at insert time by the expression  `IF(modulo(number, 2) = 0, 'even', 'odd')`.

## Adding data

Let's add 10 million rows

```sql
INSERT INTO matcolumn
SELECT 
    number
FROM numbers(10000000);
```

## Test data

Let's now see how many even numbers have we inserted using the traditional way:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM matcolumn
WHERE (number % 2) = 0;
```

and using the materialised column:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM matcolumn
WHERE parity = 'even';
```

This is a simple example but, even so, you might actually see some interesting performance differences. You should get something on the lines of:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM matcolumn
WHERE (number % 2) = 0

┌─count()─┐
│ 5000000 │
└─────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.019 sec. Processed 10.00 million rows, 40.00 MB (533.92 million rows/s., 2.14 GB/s.) 

SELECT count()
FROM matcolumn
WHERE parity = 'even'

┌─count()─┐
│ 5000000 │
└─────────┘

1 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec. Processed 10.00 million rows, 10.00 MB (1.72 billion rows/s., 1.72 GB/s.) 
```

`0.019 sec` is quite fast for 10 million rows, indeed, but `0.006` sec is way faster!

## Where's my materialised column?

Wait a second! I have executed `SELECT * FROM matcolumn LIMIT 10` and I only see the `number` column! Where is my `parity` column?

The `asterisk` (*) in select will exclude `materialised` and `alias` columns. This happens in order to facilitate `INSERT FRON SELECT *...` operations.

## Wrapping up

Now, do some housekeeping be dropping the table basic with:

```sql
DROP TABLE matcolumn;
```
