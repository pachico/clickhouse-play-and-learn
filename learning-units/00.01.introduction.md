## What is ClickHouse?

> ClickHouseÂ® is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing of queries (OLAP).

We really recommend reading the introductory notes about ClickHouse in their official documentation but if you are really looking for a TL;DR version of it, here it is.

- Designed and developed by `Yandex Metrica`.
- Is a column oriented (as opposed to row oriented) database. This approach allows you to do faster queries over many, many rows.
- Although it offers mechanisms for updating data, these happen asynchronously and it's especially designed to analyse `facts`, immutable events, not data subject to change.
- It favours infrequent big inserts rather than frequent small ones, so you have to plan for your inserts.
- It is not transactional: remember, many things happen asynchronously and in  background.
- It exploits SIMD (same instruction, multiple data), which is the capability to process many arithmetic operations in a single CPU cycle. This is one of the reasons why it's so fast.
- It compresses data (tunable) to then be able to read it quickly. This is another reason for its speed.
- It works as `data warehouse` by connecting to other sources of data.
- It can shard and replicate data obtaining almost linear scalability.
- It supports SQL dialect with **tons** of custom functions.
- Not great for single row picking.
- It features tiered storage that allows you to decide where to store data and, most importantly, how to move it based on time expressions. This includes full S3 and compatible storage.

Some companies known to have adopted ClickHouse are  `Amadeus`, `Badoo`, `CARTO`, `CERN`, `Cisco`, `Cloudflare`, `Comcast`, `Criteo`, `eBay`, `Idealista`, `Microsoft`, `Percona`, `Sentry`, `Splunk`, `Tencent`, `Uber`, `VMWare`, `Tesla` and many more https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/introduction/adopters/

## I want to use it now

If you can't wait to get a feeling of what it means to work with lots of rows, go to https://gh-api.clickhouse.tech/play?user=play

Here some queries:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT() FROM github_events;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM github_events LIMIT 1;
```

```sql
SELECT event_type, count() c FROM github_events GROUP BY event_type ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 10;
```
