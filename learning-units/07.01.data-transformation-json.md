# Data transformation: JSON 

> ðŸ’¡ Instructions about how to use this project can be found [here](../README.md).

We have, so far, learned a lot about tables and connectivity.  
Let's get now a bit more familiar with the things you can do with the data after you have fetched it.

- [Data transformation: JSON](#data-transformation-json)
  - [Extraction](#extraction)

## Extraction

```sql
WITH '{"id":123,"name":"Django","surname":"Reinhardt"}' AS json
SELECT
    isValidJSON(json) AS is_valid,
    JSONExtractUInt(json, 'id') AS id,
    JSONExtractString(json, 'name') AS name,
    JSONType(json, 'surname') AS surname_type,
    JSONExtractKeysAndValuesRaw(json) AS key_val,
    JSONLength(json) AS length

Query id: 3c8ad0a7-37ff-4dc3-bff0-ea6145f9e5b5

Row 1:
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
is_valid:     1
id:           123
name:         Django
surname_type: String
key_val:      [('id','123'),('name','"Django"'),('surname','"Reinhardt"')]
length:       3
```

As you can imagine, you could use this form of extraction in combination with `Materialised Views`:

1. data is inserted into a table (possibly even with `Null` engine)
2. a materialised view reads the inserts and performs extractions
3. data is finally saved in another table in a normalised fashion
