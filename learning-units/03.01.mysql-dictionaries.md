# MySQL dictionaries

> 💡 Instructions about how to use this project can be found [here](../README.md).

>A dictionary is a mapping (key -> attributes) that is convenient for various types of reference lists.  
ClickHouse supports special functions for working with dictionaries that can be used in queries. It is easier and more efficient to use dictionaries with functions than a JOIN with reference tables.

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/

We'll today speak about an "external" dictionary that uses MySQL connectivity.

There are two ways to define dictionaries:

- as XML definition (legacy)
- as DDL (the one we will use)

- [MySQL dictionaries](#mysql-dictionaries)
  - [Our data](#our-data)
  - [Dictionary creation](#dictionary-creation)
  - [Table creation and data insertion](#table-creation-and-data-insertion)
  - [Wrapping up](#wrapping-up)

## Our data

We will go through this lesson by simulating a voting system for the Sakila database, which gets inserted into this project when you set it up.

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html

To connect to `MariaDB` and check its content just type `make mariadb` to log into MariaDB and then:

```sql
use sakila;
show tables;
```

## Dictionary creation

Let's first create a non replicated database for this.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS film_voting;
```

```sql
use film_voting;
```

```sql
CREATE DICTIONARY film (
    film_id UInt32,
    title String,
    description String,
    release_year UInt32
)
PRIMARY KEY film_id
SOURCE(MYSQL(
    USER 'root'
    PASSWORD 'pass'
    DB 'sakila'
    TABLE 'film'
    REPLICA(PRIORITY 1 HOST 'mariadb' PORT 3306)
))
LAYOUT(FLAT)
LIFETIME(MIN 300 MAX 360)
```

Let's dissect this: every external dictionary definition has 4 parts:

- `CREATE` attributes: being a dictionary some sort of table, think of this as the columns of this table
- `PRIMARY KEY`: this defines how data is stored and indexed
- `SOURCE`: configures the source of the data and how to connect to it
- `LIFETIME`: Frequency of dictionary updates.

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/external-dictionaries/external-dicts-dict/#dicts-external-dicts-dict

So, in our example we say that:

```sql
CREATE DICTIONARY film (
    film_id UInt32,
    title String,
    description String,
    release_year UInt32
)
...
```

our dictionary will be called film and will have 4 columns (film, title, description and release_year)...

```sql
...
PRIMARY KEY film_id
...
```

its primary id is the `film_id`, which we will use to query it...

```sql
...
SOURCE(MYSQL(
    USER 'root'
    PASSWORD 'pass'
    DB 'sakila'
    TABLE 'film'
    REPLICA(PRIORITY 1 HOST 'mariadb' PORT 3306)
))
...
```

its source is a MySQL server (in our case we will use MariaDB since they are fully compatible), specifically the table `film` in the `sakila` database...

```sql
...
LAYOUT(FLAT)
...
```

its layout is `FLAT` https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/external-dictionaries/external-dicts-dict-layout/#flat

```sql
...
LIFETIME(MIN 300 MAX 360)
...
```

And data will be refreshed every a random interval between 300 and 360. This is to avoid stampede effect.

If we created it properly, you should be able to now do:

```sql
SELECT * FROM film;
```

and get results.

## Table creation and data insertion

Now you will see the great benefits of using a dictionary.  
We will create a table where to store the votes for the films.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS film_vote
(
    film_id UInt32,
    vote UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY film_id;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO film_vote
SELECT
    rand() % 1000 as film_id,
    rand() % 10 as vote
FROM numbers(5000);
```

We have inserted 5000 votes and we want to see what are the top 5 most voted films.

We could do something like this:

```sql
SELECT
    film_id,
    sum(vote) AS result
FROM film_vote
GROUP BY film_id
ORDER BY result DESC
LIMIT 5

┌─film_id─┬─result─┐
│     889 │    117 │
│     719 │     99 │
│     599 │     99 │
│     588 │     96 │
│     537 │     91 │
└─────────┴────────┘

```

but it's not a great report. Let's use the dictionary we have created!

```sql
SELECT
    film_id,
    dictGetString('film_voting.film', 'title', toUInt64(film_id)) AS title,
    sum(vote) AS result,
    dictGetUInt32('film_voting.film', 'release_year', toUInt64(film_id)) AS release_year,
    dictGetString('film_voting.film', 'description', toUInt64(film_id)) AS description
FROM film_vote
GROUP BY film_id
ORDER BY result DESC
LIMIT 5

┌─film_id─┬─title─────────────────┬─result─┬─release_year─┬─description─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec. Processed 5.00 thousand rows, 40.00 KB (1.61 million rows/s., 12.91 MB/s.)
```

Now this looks like a great report!

We used the `dictGet` functions family to get information from the dictionary.

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/ext-dict-functions/#dictget

At any time, you can check the status of the dictionary, as always, by looking at the tables inside the system database.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.dictionaries
```

## Wrapping up

External dictionaries can connect to multiple sources and are a great way to complement append-only data (in ClickHouse) with dynamic data (OLTP databases).
