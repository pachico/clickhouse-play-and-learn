# MergeTree intro

> ðŸ’¡ Instructions about how to use this project can be found [here](../README.md).

> The MergeTree engine and other engines of this family (`*MergeTree`) are the most robust ClickHouse table engines.  
>
> Engines in the MergeTree family are designed for inserting a very large amount of data into a table. The data is quickly written to the table part by part, then rules are applied for merging the parts in the background. This method is much more efficient than continually rewriting the data in storage during insert.
>
>Main features:
>
>- Stores data sorted by primary key.  
>This allows you to create a small sparse index that helps find data faster.
>- Partitions can be used if the partitioning key is specified.
>- ClickHouse supports certain operations with partitions that are more efficient than general operations on the same data with the same result. ClickHouse also automatically cuts off the partition data where the partitioning key is specified in the query.
>- Data replication support.  
>The family of ReplicatedMergeTree tables provides data replication. For more information, see Data replication.
>- Data sampling support.
>- If necessary, you can set the data sampling method in the table.

(Pssst! BTW, there are many more engines!)

Most of the lessons will involve the `MergeTree` engine family. Feel free to browse what's available at https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/ and don't feel overwhelmed by it, we'll go step by step with it all.

## Table creation

Let's do `make clickhouse` and create a database and a table:

> ðŸ’¡ Remember: SQL sentences will require you to log in ClickHouse by typing `make clickhouse` across the entire learning path.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mergetree;
```

and use/select it:

```sql
use mergetree;
```

and create a simple table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS basic
(
    timestamp DateTime,                 -- This is a date column at second granularity
    number UInt32,                      -- This is a number that can be from 0 to 4294967295
    string String                       -- This is string that can contain any non null value
) ENGINE = MergeTree()                  -- This is where I define the table engine 
PARTITION BY toStartOfMonth(timestamp)  -- This will organize partitions to be one per month of data
ORDER BY (timestamp);                   -- This is not only defining order of data but also indexing
```

Reference: https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table/

after which we can describe it:

```sql
describe basic;
```

## Insert data

and put some basic data in it:

```sql
INSERT INTO basic VALUES(now(), 42, 'Answer to the Ultimate Question');
```

and check if it's there:

```sql
SELECT * FROM basic;
```

So far, besides this specific DDL for the creation of the table, if you have previous experience with SQL, you should find all this quite familiar.  
ClickHouse does have its own peculiarities but you will find that you can easily move around it in no time.

However, ClickHouse is about big data so let's do something that you wouldn't dare to do in your laptop with other database systems: let's insert `10 million rows`!

```sql
INSERT INTO basic
SELECT 
    now() - (rand() % 99) AS timestamp, 
    number AS number,
    generateUUIDv4() AS string 
FROM numbers(10000000)
```

A few things are going on here but the important thing is to know that we have dynamically generated 10 million unique rows and inserted them in the table.

Now, storing data is great but useless if we cannot query it, which many times is the bottleneck for certain technologies.

## Query and aggregate

Let's see if we can easily do some aggregations over this data.

Firstly, let's check if all the data is there:

```sql
SELECT formatReadableQuantity(count()) FROM basic;
```

Great, now that we confirmed that we have 10 million entries, let's do some aggregation, just to get familiar with the syntax:

```sql
SELECT
    sum(number),
    min(number),
    max(number),
    uniq(number),
    avg(number),
    quantile(0.95)(number)
FROM basic;
```

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/

And now let's aggregate with grouping as well:

```sql
SELECT
    timestamp,
    count() AS c
FROM basic
GROUP BY timestamp
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

By now you should be thinking `"yes, I understand the syntax"` and `"indeed, this is quite a fast beast"`.

## Table operations

Here's the thing:

> ClickHouse is designed to do analytics over facts (immutable) and many of the things that happen in ClickHouse happen in the background.

Keep this in mind because it might work against your expectations in certain cases.

### Deleting data

> Note  
The ALTER TABLE prefix makes this syntax different from most other systems supporting SQL. It is intended to signify that unlike similar queries in OLTP databases this is a heavy operation not designed for frequent use.

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/delete/

This allows you to delete data with a `WHERE` clause and, as being implemented as a `mutation` (see docs) it is asynchronous task.

```sql
ALTER TABLE basic DELETE WHERE 1;
```

The `WHERE 1` clause implies that everything will be deleted.

Since it's a mutation (async task performed in the background), we can check for its status with a query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM system.mutations FORMAT Vertical;
```

where the column `is_done` tells you if it's been completed already.

Note that we also added `FORMAT Vertical`, which in other systems is specified as `\G` (it also works in ClickHouse).  
Every query can be output in several formats, which you might find handy when importing or exporting data. See all available formats here: https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/formats/.

However, if you want to just delete all data, you might want to simply use:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE basic;
```

as you would do in other systems.

### Updating data

Same async implications as deleting data: remember, it's asynchronous!

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/update/

### Altering table layout

Let's add another column since we want to learn how to deal with `null` values.

```sql
ALTER TABLE basic ADD COLUMN nullablestring Nullable(String) AFTER string;
```

https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/column/#alter_add-column

With this, we have added a column that `can contain null values`! (Although necessary in many cases, it is known that you pay a performance degradation by allowing nullable values.)

See how we wrap the column type with a `Nullable()` key word.

Let's now insert data into this version of the table including some null values:

```sql
INSERT INTO basic SELECT
    now() - (rand() % 99) AS timestamp,
    number AS number,
    generateUUIDv4() AS string,
    if((number % 2) = 0, string, NULL) AS nullablestring
FROM numbers(10000000);
```

This is as the previous one but, it will insert `null` in the `nullablestring` column if `number` is odd.

Let's see how it went:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM basic
WHERE isNull(nullablestring);
```

## Wrapping up

Now, do some housekeeping be dropping the table basic with:

```sql
DROP TABLE basic;
```
